I am working on a personal project called "circleofsuck". The project is a tool to find large sequences of teams in a league where each team has defeated the next team in the sequence, and the last team has defeated the first team, forming a complete cycle. This is also known as a Circle of Suck. I have implemented an algorithm to find when this occurs within a league. With game results data, I plan to create a Twitter bot that creates a post and graphic when a Circle of Suck has occurred or could potentially occur. I also plan to make a website that visualizes these. I am currently comparing various APIs available to find one that will suit my project's needs.
